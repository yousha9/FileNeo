# FileNeo
This is my first Python script, you can modify it as you want and if there are any bugs (as it was not tested thoroughly) just let me know. If the modified script is better, send me a copy so that i can learn and get experience. 

FileNeo can be used to download any file from the net by simply pasting the URL and absolute PATH where it should be kept on your PC and the system will process it automatically without even clicking the Download button. Find your favorite documents, video, picture and download them via FileNeo
